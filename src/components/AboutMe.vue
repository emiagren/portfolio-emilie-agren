              <h4>I am an open-minded and creative person who naturally sets a high standard for what I do.</h4>
              <p>
                For as long as I can remember I have had an eye for the visual in an artistic kind of way. As a kid one 
                of my biggest passions were drawing. As a teenager I discovered photo editing and web design. In my 
                twenties I took classes in web design and photography, which were favorite subjects at that point. 
                Through my previous full time job I spiked an interest for IT when doing minor IT works in the coms 
                room and in our offices.
                <br>
                <br>
                So when I wanted to change careers two years ago, I chose Frontend Developer, something that I am very 
                happy today that I chose. One of the things I love most about Frontend developing is that it offers such 
                a broad spectrum of orientations depending on what you like to do and what youâ€™re best at. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Whoever hires me gets an adaptable and loyal colleague who enjoys working in a team as well as independently.
                I look forward to putting my newly acquired skills to the test in a rapidly growing industry with seemingly 
                endless opportunities.
